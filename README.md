# k_distribution

This implements a basic go mysql driver. 

it connects to a local db (no need for remote connections at this point)

- Connection is made via username / password
- Patrick Skelley has password access to this test data
- Makes a query to the db and retrieves some test data
- Adds test data to a go struct
- Prints out one of the fields of the struct for proof that the query ran
